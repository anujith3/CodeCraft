This is a simple Python script that checks the strength of a password based on five common security criteria: minimum length of 8 characters, presence of at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character (like `!@#$%^&*()`). The script uses regular expressions to check each of these conditions and assigns a score out of 5. Based on the score, it gives clear feedback ranging from "Very weak" to "Very strong," or prompts the user if no input is given. To use it, simply run the script in your terminal or IDE, enter a password when prompted, and receive immediate feedback on its strength.
